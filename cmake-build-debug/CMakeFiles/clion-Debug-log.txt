-- Could NOT find OpenSSL, try to set the path to OpenSSL root folder in the system variable OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR (missing: OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPoco.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Poco", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Poco" with any of
  the following names:

    PocoConfig.cmake
    poco-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Poco" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Poco_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Poco"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
